# StreamFlow

## Description

StreamFlow is a project management tool that helps teams visualize and organize their work. It is based on the Kanban method, which is a pull-based system that allows teams to focus on delivering the most important work first. The key features of a Kanban application typically include:

Boards: Users can create multiple boards to represent different projects or work streams. Each board contains columns that represent different stages of work, such as "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done".

Cards: Users can add cards to represent individual tasks or pieces of work. Cards can be moved between columns to reflect their progress.

Labels: Users can add labels to cards to categorize them and make them easier to find.

Assignments: Users can assign cards to other team members to indicate who is responsible for the task.

Due dates: Users can set due dates for cards to help prioritize and manage the team's work.

Notifications: Users can receive notifications when cards are moved, assigned, or updated.

Integration: The kanban application can integrate with other tools such as email, calendar, and chat to help teams stay up-to-date and collaborate effectively.

Analytics: The application can provide analytics such as Lead Time, Cycle Time, Throughput, and more, to help teams understand how they are working and identify areas for improvement.

In summary, a Kanban application is a powerful tool that can help teams visualize and manage their work, improve collaboration, and increase productivity.
